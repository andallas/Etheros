Etheros
=======

Etheros is a space exploration and survival game. It is 2D and has a top-down perspective. Procedural generation and modularity is a big focus of the game. The game world is open-ended and procedural, allowing unlimited replayability and content. All ships (player and NPCs) are made up of one or more ship components that add to the stats and abilities of the specific ship. NPC ships are created procedurally with the modular ship components.
